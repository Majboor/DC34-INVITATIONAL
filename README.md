## Impact Caymol Fastpitch: Brand Design Guide

### 1. Brand Essence & Orientation
The Impact Caymol brand projects an image of strength, focus, and modern professionalism. The design philosophy is minimalist and powerful, positioning the organization as a high-performance athletic program.

•⁠  ⁠*Confident:* Bold typography and high-contrast color scheme.  
•⁠  ⁠*Modern:* Clean lines, flat graphics, structured grid-based layouts.  
•⁠  ⁠*Focused:* Minimalist palette emphasizes athletes and brand identity.  
•⁠  ⁠*Athletic:* Energetic, strong, competitive sports aesthetic.  

### 2. Logo System
The "IC" monogram is the cornerstone of the brand identity.

•⁠  ⁠*Full Logo Lockup:* Stylized "IC" with "IMPACT" arched above and "CAYмол" below. Formal, primary branding use.  
•⁠  ⁠*Primary Monogram:* Standalone "IC" mark; versatile and frequently used.  
•⁠  ⁠*Team-Specific Lockup:* "IC" + team name in capitalized sans-serif.  
•⁠  ⁠*Usage Rule:* Maintain clear space around logos to preserve visual impact.  

### 3. Color Palette
Strict monochrome palette with high contrast. Photography provides any vibrant color.

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary Black | #000000 | Backgrounds, text, primary logo |
| Primary White | #FFFFFF | Backgrounds, text, reversed logo |
| Secondary Grey | #A9A9A9 | Background panels, accents, secondary text |

### 4. Typography
Clear hierarchy for readability and athletic feel.

•⁠  ⁠*Headline & Impact Font:* Condensed, bold, all-caps sans-serif.  
  - Use: Major headlines, calls to action, player names  
  - Example fonts: Bebas Neue, Oswald (Bold), Anton  

•⁠  ⁠*Body & Information Font:* Clean, geometric sans-serif.  
  - Use: Dates, locations, descriptive text  
  - Example fonts: Montserrat, Lato, Roboto  

•⁠  ⁠*Accent Font:* Strong slab serif, primarily in logo lockup.  
  - Minimal use outside logo  

### 5. Design & Layout Principles
Structured, clean, template-driven compositions.

•⁠  ⁠*Structured Layouts:* Split-screen or panel-based; color blocks for text, photo areas for imagery.  
•⁠  ⁠*Geometric Foundation:* Grid-based design; rectangles and bars frame content.  
•⁠  ⁠*Flat & Minimalist:* No gradients, shadows, textures, or 3D effects.  
•⁠  ⁠*Photography Integration:* High-quality action shots; full-bleed or contained in grids.  
•⁠  ⁠*Consistent Branding:* "IC" monogram and hashtags (e.g., ⁠ #bethehunter ⁠) as integral design elements.
